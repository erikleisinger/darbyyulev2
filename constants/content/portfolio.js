           description: `Pebble is a Web-App designed for Curling teams to track their progress and games. I was the sole UI/UX Designer on the project, I worked along a team of technical professionals to make the vision happen. In the early stages of research and ideation, I realized that most curlers do their own stats and tracking on spreadsheets. It is difficult for more than one team member to access statistics or go over games because the team lead is normally the only one with access. On top of that, curling is a very friendly, social sport and most curlers do not like using traditional sporting apps because they feel too intense and exclusive. They need an app that is inclusive to casual players and easy to track games or stats. I set out to answer the question, ‘How might we make it easy for a user to navigate, understand, and interact with the app in a meaningful way?’`,

From there, they can challenge other teams to games. The game results automatically update the team’s stats as well as the player’s and club’s.`
